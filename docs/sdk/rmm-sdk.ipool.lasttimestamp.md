Timestamp of last curve update.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
lastTimestamp: Time;
```

## Remarks

This is the most important parameter when interacting with this pool's curve. The `tau`<!-- -->, time until expiry<!-- -->\`<!-- -->, is calculated by the difference of maturity and lastTimestamp, which affects the theoretical reserves of the curve.

For example, if swapping, the current timestamp must be used, requiring this lastTimestamp to be updated to it. Else, the swap would be computing an invariant on a stale curve, which will most likely make the swap fail.
