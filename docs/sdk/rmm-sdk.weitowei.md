## weiToWei() function

> This API is provided as a preview for developers and may change based on feedback that we receive. Do not use this API in a production environment.
> 

Gets a Wei class from a wei string value.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare function weiToWei(wei: string, decimals?: number): Wei;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  wei | string |  |
|  decimals | number |  |

<b>Returns:</b>

Wei

`wei` but as a Wei instance.

## Remarks

This converts the wei value by using the parseWei function, which multiplies it by 10^decimals. Therefore, to get the actual string as a Wei class we have to divided it down by the same scalar.

 wei Raw wei value as a string to convert into a Wei class.  decimals Decimal places of wei value, since its an integer in the EVM.
